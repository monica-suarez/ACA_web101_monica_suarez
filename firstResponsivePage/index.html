                    When one feels happy, one generally has positive thoughts and feelings. Imaging studies suggest that the happiness response originates partly in the limbic cortex. Another area called the precuneus also plays a role.

                    Cogito, ergo sum, (Latin: “I think, therefore I am) dictum coined by the French philosopher René Descartes in his Discourse on Method (1637) as a first step in demonstrating the attainability of certain knowledge. It is the only statement to survive the test of his methodic doubt.

                    One of my greatest enjoyments in life is making soap, the old fashioned way. It is made with a mixture of different oils, as well as a water-soluble liquid (like water or goat's milk)that has been mixed with sodium hydroxide. Once the mix has been blended, it is hardened overnight.
